## About it:

write a code that opens the file _project_twitter_data.csv_ which has the fake generated twitter data (the text of a tweet, the number of retweets of that tweet, and the number of replies to that tweet). The task is to build a sentiment classifier, which will detect how positive or negative each tweet is. 

## Scatterplot:

Upload the csv file to Excel or Google Sheets and produce a graph of the Net Score vs Number of Retweets.
